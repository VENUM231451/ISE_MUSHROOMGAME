This folder hosts newly downloaded SFX used by the game:

- wing.wav       -> jump
- swoosh.wav     -> dash and UI hover fallback
- point.wav      -> coin pickup and UI click fallback
- hit.wav        -> shield bump / minor hit
- die.wav        -> game over

Optional (not required but supported if present):
- step.wav       -> footstep cadence for Level 2
- menu_theme.wav -> looping menu theme music

Place additional safely licensed WAV/MP3/OGG files here. The game will
auto-detect `menu_theme` for menu music and `step` for footsteps.
